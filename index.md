_**[Natural language processing on Fed announcements](https://sikaiwang224.github.io/teamproject-/)**_ <a name="fed"></a>

How do Federal Reserve announcements influence the stock market according to Natural language processing, particularly the ETFs across various sectors?

<img src="images/sentimentanalysis.png" alt="julio" width="500"/>

### Specific research question:
- What is the overall sentiment and intensity in the each announcements?
- How do these sentiment scores correlate with subsequent stock market movements for the sector ETFs?
- Can we predict stock market reactions based on the sentiment derived from announcements?

### Our Hypotheses and Prediction:
- Positive sentiment score in announcements leads to a positive stock market reaction.
- Negative sentiment score in announcements leads to a negative stock market reaction.
- According to the hypotheses above, we believe that every time when the Federal Reserve announcements related to a piece of good news are released, the stock of companies will show a good trend and vice versa. Whether it has a piece of good news is determined by the sentiment score that we measure.

    "Please note that this script may not always work as expected due to certain limitations and potential errors. Firstly, Alpha Vantage, the API we're using, imposes a limit on the number of API calls that can be made within a certain period. For free users, this limit is typically set at 5 API requests per minute and 500 requests per day. If you exceed this limit, the API may not return the expected data, which can cause the script to fail or produce inaccurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, sometimes an API might return an error, or the structure of the API response might change unexpectedly. Our script expects certain keys, such as 'SharesOutstanding', to be present in the API's response. If these keys are not included in the response due to an error or change on the API's side, a KeyError will be triggered, causing the script to stop. It's important to be aware of these potential issues when running the script and interpreting its output."

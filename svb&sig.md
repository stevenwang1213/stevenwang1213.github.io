# The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature bank 

### Purpose of this Project
In March 2023, two major banks collapsed in the United States: Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank. The collapses of these two banks sent shockwaves through the financial system and raised concerns about the stability of the banking industry.

### Key Phase
#### This project will analyze the reasons why SVB and Signature Bank collapsed and propose ways to prevent future bank failures. The project will be divided into three phases:
- Phase 1: Analysis of the collapse of SVB and Signature Bank
- Phase 2: Identification of risk factors that contributed to the collapse
- Phase 3: Development of recommendations to prevent future bank failures

The project will use a variety of research methods, including data analysis, interviews, and case studies. The project will also draw on the expertise of experts in the field of banking and finance.

The findings of the project will be disseminated to a variety of stakeholders, including regulators, banks, and the public. The project is expected to make a significant contribution to the understanding of bank failures and the development of measures to prevent future failures.
